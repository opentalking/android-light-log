### android-light-log

I'm so lazy and I don't want to print log like : Log.d(TAG,"message")

And I don't know which code trigger off the log.

Now,you have  `light-log`

Just like Log

```
		ILog.v("level v : Activity Life Cycle");
		ILog.i("level i : Activity Life Cycle");
		ILog.d("level d : Activity Life Cycle");
		ILog.w("level w : Activity Life Cycle");
		ILog.e("level e : Activity Life Cycle");
		ILog.wtf("level wtf : Activity Life Cycle");
		
```

Now ,you don't have to write TAG and your console will show like this:
